<p><i>Dear Sir</i>—We, the undersigned, having listened carefully
to your Sermon, preached at the A. M. E. Ebenezer Church,
on Sabbath last, April 13th, a day set apart by the Colored
Churches in Georgetown and Washington as a day of Thanksgiving
and Prayer, in view of Emancipation in the District,
and being deeply impressed by its appropriateness, its wisdom,
and valuable practical advice; and believing that such a sermon
should be within the reach of all the colored people of this District
and the United States; we therefore solicit you to allow
us to print the same in pamphlet form.</p>

<p>St. Paul addressed the Epistles to Timothy, the young Bishop
of Ephesus, for the purpose of giving him instructions touching
the false doctrines inculcated by certain false teachers, as well
as instructions respecting the qualifications of the Christian
ministry, their duties to themselves, to God, and the flock committed
by the Holy Spirit to their special guidance.</p>

<p>But foremost of all the duties which he enjoined upon the
Ephesian ministry and laity were those of making “Supplications,
prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks for all men.”
For men in general, embracing the whole family of Adam, in
all their <em>varieties</em> as nations, tribes, communities, peoples.</p>

<p>This is God-like, because the Eternal loves all, and manifests
the infinity of his nature, by his universal care for all mankind.
In this, He also demonstrates His universal Fatherhood, and
thereby establishes the brotherhood of man.</p>

<p>But guided by the benevolence of unerring wisdom, the
Apostle descends from a general to a particular statement of
the case, and <em>commands</em> us to single out from among the nations
of the earth their chieftains—<em>Kings</em> and <em>authorities</em>—for whom
we are to make special “Supplications, prayers, intercessions,
and giving of thanks.”</p>

<p>To the cheerful and fervent performance of this gracious
work, he presses several motives upon us—“that we may live<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty”—because
“it is good and acceptable in the sight of God our
Saviour”—because God “will have all men to be saved and to
come unto the knowledge of the truth.” Let us briefly trace
out this line of thought.</p>

<p>To supplicate, is to <em>implore</em> God <em>submissively</em>. To pray to
God, is to adore Him for His glorious perfection, to confess our
sins to Him, and to beseech Him for mercy and pardon. To
intercede with God is to entreat Him by the fervent, effectual
prayer of faith, to be reconciled to offending man. This we
may do as well for our enemies as for our friends.</p>

<p>We are gathered to celebrate the emancipation, yea, rather,
the <em>Redemption</em> of the enslaved people of the District of Columbia,
the exact number of whom we have no means of ascertaining,
because, since the benevolent intention of Congress
became manifest, many have been removed by their owners
beyond the reach of this beneficent act.</p>

<p>Our pleasing task then, is to welcome to the Churches, the
homesteads, and circles of free colored Americans, those who
remain to enjoy <em>the boon of holy Freedom</em>.</p>

<p>Brethren, sisters, friends, we say welcome to our Churches,
welcome to our homesteads, welcome to our social circles.</p>

<p>Enter the great family of Holy Freedom; not to <em>lounge in
sinful indolence</em>, not to <em>degrade yourselves by vice</em>, nor to <em>corrupt
society by licentiousness</em>, neither to <em>offend the laws by crime</em>, but
to the <em>enjoyment of a well regulated liberty</em>, the offspring of
generous laws; of law as just as generous, as righteous as just—a
liberty to be <em>perpetuated</em> by equitable law, and sanctioned by
the divine; for law is never equitable, righteous, just, until it
harmonizes with the will of Him, who is “<em>King</em> of kings, and
<em>Lord</em> of lords,” and who commanded Israel to <em>have but one law
for the home-born</em> and the <em>stranger</em>.</p>

<p>We repeat ourselves, welcome then <em>ye ransomed ones</em>; welcome
<em>not</em> to indolence, to vice, licentiousness, and crime, but to
a well-regulated liberty, sanctioned by the Divine, maintained
by the Human law.</p>

<p>Welcome to habits of industry and thrift—to duties of religion
and piety—to obligations of law, order, government—of
government divine, of government human: these two, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
not one, are inseparable. The man who refuses to obey divine
law, will never obey human laws. <em>The divine first</em>, the <em>human
next</em>. The latter is the consequence of the former, and follows
it as light does the rising sun.</p>

<p>We invite you to our Churches, because we desire you to be
religious; to be more than religious; we urge you <em>to be godly</em>.
We entreat you to never be content until you are emancipated
from sin, from sin without, and from sin within you. But this
kind of freedom is attained only through the faith of Jesus,
love for Jesus, obedience to Jesus. As certain as the American
Congress has <em>ransomed</em> you, so certain, yea, more certainly has
Jesus redeemed you from the guilt and power of sin by his own
precious blood.</p>

<p>As you are now free in body, so now seek to be free in soul
and spirit, from sin and Satan. The <em>noblest freeman is he whom
Christ makes free</em>.</p>

<p>We invite you to our homesteads, in order that we may aid
you as well by the power of good examples as by the beauty of
holy precept, in raising up intelligent, virtuous, pious, happy
families. We invite you to our social circles, in order that you
may have none of those inducements which grow out of a mere
love of society, to frequent the <em>gambling hells</em>, and groggeries,
which gradually lead their votaries to infamy and the pit that
is bottomless.</p>

<p>Permit us, also, to advise you to seek every opportunity for
the cultivation of your minds. To the adults we say, enter
the Sunday Schools and the Night Schools, so opportunely
opened by Dr. Pierson, in behalf of the American Tract Society.
In these latter you can very soon learn to read the precious
word of God, even before you shall have a familiar knowledge
of the letters which constitute the alphabet.</p>

<p><em>Rest not till you have learned to read the Bible.</em> ’Tis the
greatest, the best of books. In it is contained the Divine law.
O! meditate therein by day and by night, for “the law of the
Lord is perfect, converting the soul; the testimony of the Lord
is sure, making wise the simple; the statutes of the Lord are
right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the Lord is
pure, enlightening the eyes;—more to be desired are they than
gold, yea, than much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
the honeycomb.” “<em>In keeping of them there is great reward.</em>”
Yield uniform, implicit obedience to their teachings. They
will purify your hearts and make them the abodes of the Ever-Blessed
Trinity.</p>

<p>When you shall have reached this point, you will be morally
prepared to recognize and respond to all the relations of civilized
and christianized life.</p>

<p>But of the children take <em>special care</em>. Heaven has entrusted
them to you for a <em>special purpose</em>. What is that purpose? Not
merely to eat and to drink, still less to <em>gormandize</em>. Not
merely to dress finely in broadcloths, silks, satins, jewelry, nor
to dance to the sound of the tambourine and fiddle; but <em>to learn
them how to live and how to die—to train them for great usefulness
on earth—to prepare them for greater glory in heaven</em>.</p>

<p>Keep your children in the schools, even if you have to eat
less, drink less and wear coarser raiments; though you eat but
two meals a day, purchase but one change of garment during
the year, and relinquish all the luxuries of which we are so
fond, but which are as injurious to health and long life as they
are pleasing to the taste.</p>

<p>Let the education of your children penetrate the heart.—That
education which forgets, or purposely omits, the culture
of the heart, <em>is better adapted to devilism than manhood</em>. But
the education which reaches the heart, moulds it, humbles it
before the Cross, is rather the work of the homestead than the
common school or the college. It is given by the <em>parents</em>
rather than the schoolmaster—by the <em>mother</em> rather than the
father.</p>

<p>How important, then, that the mothers be <em>right-minded</em>; that
our young women, of whom our mothers come, be brought up
with a high sense of personal character—be taught to prefer
virtue to gold, and death itself rather than a violated chastity.
The women make the men; therefore the women should be
greater than the men, in order that they be the mothers of
great men. I mean good men, <em>for none are great who are not
good</em>.</p>

<p>But this requires the transforming grace of God; requires
that our mothers be women of strong faith and fervent daily
prayers; requires that they live beneath the wings of the Cherubim—at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
the foot of the Cross—loving the God-man “whose
favor is life, and whose loving kindness is better than life.”</p>

<p>Such mothers will care for the heart education of their children,
and will consequently lay continuous siege to the Throne
of God in behalf of their sons and daughters, even as the Syrophœnician
mother importuned the compassionate Jesus in
behalf of her afflicted daughter, or as Queen Esther did Ahasuerus
in behalf of her menaced kinsmen.</p>

<p>Such mothers will carefully train their children, as Moses
was trained by his mother, preserving him pure from <em>the vices
of a Court</em> and the baneful examples of lordly superiors: or,
like Susanna Wesley, will educate their sons, as she did John
and Charles, in the atmosphere of such spiritual excellence,
and with such a moral power, as will make them ministering
angels of good to man and glory to God Most High.</p>

<p>Lastly—Let us advise you respecting money. Some people
value it too much, others too little. Of these extremes take
the medium; for money has its proper value. That value <em>lies
in its adaptedness to promote the ends of Christian enlightenment</em>;
to purchase the best medical aid and other comforts in the days
of affliction; to administer to the wants of old age, and to enable
us to assist in making mankind wiser and better.</p>

<p>But how are we to get money? Get it by diligent labor.
Work, work, work! Shun no work that will bring you an
honest penny. ’Tis honorable to labor with our own hands.
God works, and shall man be greater than God? Fools only
think labor dishonorable. Wise men feel themselves honored
in following the example of God, whose works adorn and bless
both heaven and earth.</p>

<p>But when you get the pennies save them. Then you will
soon have dollars. The dollars will enable you to buy comfortable
homes for yourselves and your children.</p>

<p>You can save your pennies—yea, dollars—if you will <em>run
away</em> from whiskey, rum and tobacco. A few years ago an
intelligent minister said that the colored people of the District
of Columbia spent ten thousand dollars a year for tobacco.—What
a sum for poison! Better take that money to build
churches and school houses; better take it to obtain and pay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
thoroughly educated teachers for your pulpits and your school
houses—<em>the schoolmasters</em> as well as the preachers.</p>

<p>Work for money; work every day, work diligently, and <em>save
your money when you get it</em>.</p>

<p>Be <em>obliging</em> and <em>faithful</em> to your employers, and you will be
sure to keep your places. Never be above your business.—Many
a man has ruined himself and his family by this foolish
pride.</p>

<p>Ever since the first stone in the foundations of the Universe
was laid by God’s own hand till now, he has been working,
and will continue working through endless ages. Follow his
glorious example. Work, work, work, for an honest penny;
but when you get it, pause and think three times before you
spend it; but when you spend it, be sure it will yield a permanent
benefit.</p>

<p>That the hearty welcome which we have given you, our <em>ransomed</em>
kinsmen, may be rendered a blessing, and that the
advices which we have tendered may be as good seed sown in
good ground, we shall continue to make supplications, prayers,
intercessions and thanksgivings to Him whose care reaches all,
because His love embraces all.</p>

<p>To Him we commend you, O ye who are now as sheep without
a shepherd—as <em>exiles in the land of your nativity</em>.</p>

<p>May He who led Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, as they wandered
over Canaan and Egypt, guide, protect and bless you;
raise up kind, influential friends to do you good; and when the
purposes of his grace shall have been accomplished in you, may
you be able, like Jacob, to say: “With my staff I passed over
this Jordan, and now I am become two bands.”</p>

<p>Now, if we ask, who has sent us this great deliverance? The
answer shall be, the Lord; the Lord God Almighty, the God
of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob.</p>

<p>But as He blessed the chosen seed, by the ministry of men
and angels, so in our case, the angels of mercy, justice and
liberty, hovering over the towering Capitol, inspired the heads
and hearts of the noble men who have plead the cause of the
poor, the needy and enslaved, in the Senate and House of
Representatives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span></p>

<p>For the oppressed and enslaved of all peoples, God has raised
up, and will continue to raise up, his Moses and Aaron. Sometimes
the hand of the Lord is so signally displayed that Moses
and Aaron are not recognized. Seldom do they recognize
themselves.</p>

<p>There was neither bow, spear, nor shield, in the hand of
Israel, when the Lord led him forth from Egypt, so also, there
was no weapon of offence nor defence in your hands when this
<em>ransom</em> was brought you.</p>

<p>“Great and marvelous are thy works, Lord God Almighty,
just and true are thy ways, thou King of Saints. Who shall
not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? We praise thee,
we bless thee, we worship thee, we glorify thee, we give thanks
to thee for thy great glory. O Lord God, Heavenly King,
God the Father Almighty.”</p>

<p>Thou, O Lord, and thou alone couldst have moved the heart
of this Nation to have done so great a deed for this weak, despised
and needy people!</p>

<p>We will, therefore, make supplications, prayers, intercessions,
and thanksgivings, for “All that are in authority.”</p>

<p>The duty of supplications in behalf of the Government is
rendered more binding upon us, when we consider the circumstances
under which it was written. St. Paul lived under the
reign of Nero, the bloody emperor, who having set Rome on
fire, amused himself with drinking and music while the city
was in flames; and afterwards, accused the Christians of the
crime which he himself had committed, thereby causing many
of them to be put to death in the most cruel manner.</p>

<p>Now, if it was the duty of the ancient Christians to pray for
such monsters of wickedness, by how much more is it our duty
to pray for a Christian Government.</p>

<p>Congress need our supplications, they shall have them. The
President and his Cabinet need our prayers, they shall possess
them. The Supreme Court, that awful emblem of impartial
justice, need our intercessions, it shall not be forgotten.</p>

<p>Upon all these departments of law, authority and power, we
shall beseech the God of Nations to send the spirit of wisdom,
justice, liberty—of wisdom seeing the end from the beginning—of
justice incorruptible—of liberty governed by righteous law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span></p>

<p>To make supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgiving
for these authorities, is the peculiar privilege of the
Colored People in the United States.</p>

<p>They are not permitted, as in the days of the Revolution and
the war of 1812, to take up arms in defence of the Government.
Some, both among Anglo-Saxons and Anglo-Africans, complain
of this prohibition. For my part, I am glad of it, because
I think I see the hand of God in it.</p>

<p>The present war is a kind of family quarrel. Therefore, let
a stranger take heed how he meddles, lest both parties unite to
drive him out of the house. “Why shouldst thou meddle to
thy hurt?”</p>

<p>But we can wield a power in behalf of the Government
which neither rifled cannon, nor mortar, nor rocket-battery can
assail, nor bomb-proof walls resist.</p>

<p><em>That power</em> is the right arm of God—of God, who lifts up
and casts down nations according as they obey, or disregard
the principles of truth, justice, liberty.</p>

<p>The service of prayer which is required from us, contemplates
the most difficult as well as the noblest objects. It contemplates
the end of the war. It contemplates legislation before
and after the end.</p>

<p>Now, to manage this war, so as to bring permanent good to
all concerned, requires more than human wisdom—more than
human power. To legislate so as to make the masses see and
feel that the laws are just, wise, beneficial, demand more than
human learning or skill in government. To determine the
sense and just application of these laws as Judges—to execute
them faithfully and impartially as a Chief Magistrate, O how
much of the spirit of God is needful! How much in the President!
how much in his Cabinet!</p>

<p>Then there is the army. Let us not forget the brave men
who constitute it—who have left their comfortable homes,
beloved families, fond parents, affectionate sisters and brothers,
for the hardships, dangers and painful deaths of the battle
field.</p>

<p>Let us pray that, as <em>some of them are</em>, so <em>all may become</em>, soldiers
of the Cross; so that such as are doomed to fall in the
fight, may rise from their gory beds to obtain a crown of life;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
and those who may return to the peaceful pursuits of civil life,
may be wiser and better men.</p>

<p>Now, then, although weak, few, despised and persecuted, we
can aid all these departments of government by our daily supplications,
prayers and intercessions.</p>

<p>In doing this service, we can accomplish what we could not
if we were leading the van of battle; for conquering armies are
preceded and succeeded by anguish, misery and death, but our
service brings down nothing but blessings upon all.</p>

<p>They are also weapons, “not carnal, but mighty through
God, to the pulling down of strongholds;” even the casting
down of principalities and powers—the moving of heaven and
earth.</p>

<p>Take two examples: When Israel fought against the five
kings of the Amorites, Joshua prayed and the sun stood still
upon Gibeon, while the moon hung over the valley of Ajalon,
till Israel had conquered.</p>

<p>“John Knox was a man famous for his power in prayer, so
that Queen Mary used to say she feared his prayers more than
all the armies of Europe. And events showed she had reason
to do it. He used to be in such an agony for the deliverance
of his country that he could not sleep. He had a place in his
garden, where he used to go to pray. One night he and
several friends were praying together, and as they prayed
Knox spoke and said that deliverance had come. He could
not tell what had happened, but he felt that something had
taken place, for God had heard their prayers. What was it?
Why the next news they heard was: ‘Queen Mary is dead!’”</p>

<p>But the motives for all this work of mercy, faith, and love
as furnished by the text are as weighty as they are numerous.</p>

<p>1st. “That we may lead a quiet and peaceable life.” Peace
and quietude are some of the conditions of happiness. Dr.
Adam Bluche says: “If the State be not in safety, the individual
cannot be secure; self preservation, therefore, should lead
men to pray for the government under which they live. Rebellions
and insurrections seldom terminate even in political
good—and even where the government is radically bad, revolutions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
are most precarious and hazardous. They who wish
such commotions would not be quiet under the most mild and
benevolent government.” This is true of communities and
nations, as well as of individuals. We all desire it, and therefore
it is our duty to labor for it by every instrument which
Infinite wisdom has ordained and man can employ. And lo!
how excellent the instruments! <em>Prayers</em>, <em>supplications</em>, <em>intercessions</em>—thanksgiving.
As Aaron approached the Mercy Seat,
with the smoking censor, and was accepted, so do we approach
the throne of the Eternal with the burning incense of heaven’s
own making, and will be accepted. O, let us supplicate God
for the peace and quietude of the whole nation!</p>

<p>2d. The other motive which Inspiration presents is, that we
may live “<em>in all godliness</em> and <em>honesty</em>.” Godliness first,
honesty afterwards. The latter is the fruit of the former. The
godly man, is he who fears God and keeps his commandments.
Such a man will be honest in words as well as in deeds; in
matters of truth as well as in matters of property. <em>Honesty is
the only policy of godliness.</em> Colored men, write this sentiment
upon your hearts, engrave it in your memory. Let all your
thoughts, words, actions, be controlled by this principle, <em>it is
always safe to be honest, as it is always safe to be godly</em>. One
has said, that “An honest man is the noblest work of God.”
But whence comes the honest man? Does he not spring out of
the godly? Most assuredly. For no man is truly honest, uniformly
honest, and universally honest, but he who is godly.
Therefore be godly, and you will be honest in all things, at all
times, in all places.</p>

<p>3d. The third motive for this heavenly duty, this intercession
in behalf of the Government is, that “It is good and
acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour.” Whatever God
accepts and pronounces good, <em>must be good</em>: good in itself; good
in its effects, always good; good for man, because ordained
of God.</p>

<p>4th. The last motive we present for this godlike work is,
that God “<em>Will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the
knowledge of the truth.</em>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span></p>

<p>Hence, we must pray for these Authorities not as public men
only, but as private individuals also,—not as Chieftains of the
Nation only, but as heads of families also,—as husbands,
fathers, Christians. So that, while they think, write, speak,
act for the public weal, their own souls may be brought under
the saving power of the Gospel, and with all the members of
their respective families be made the heirs of the grace of life.</p>

<p>O, that God may bring them all to the knowledge of the
truth as it is in Christ Jesus! O, that every one of these Authorities
may become a holy, wise, and just man! Then will
the laws be enacted in righteousness and executed in the fear
of the Lord.</p>

<p>These motives are enforced upon our considerations by the
glorious example of the Lord Jesus Christ,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> who is the Mediator
between God and Man, who ever liveth to make intercession
for his foes as well as his friends, and with whom there is no
respect of persons. Black men, red men, white men, are all
alike before Him, and rise or fall, live or die as they please or
offend Him.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[A]</a> When St. Cyprian defended himself before the Roman Pro-Consul, he said, “We
pray to God not only for ourselves but for all mankind, and particularly for the
Emperors.”</p>

<p>Tertullian in his Apology is more particular: “We pray for all the Emperors,
that God may grant them long life, a secure government, a prosperous family,
vigorous troops, a faithful senate, an obedient people; that the whole world may be
in peace; and that God may grant both to Cæsar; and to every man, the accomplishment
of their just desires.”</p>

<p>So Origen: “We pray for kings and rulers, that with their royal authority they
may be found possessing a wise and prudent mind.”</p>

<p class="right"><i>See Dr. A. Clarke on the text.</i></p>

</div>

<p>To make prayers, intercessions, supplications, thanksgivings
for national authorities you now clearly see <em>is a command from
heaven</em>. Obey it, and you shall be blessed—always do it, and
you shall be made a blessing to others. Whom God has blessed
no man can curse. If God has blessed this nation, neither
internal foes, nor foreign enemies can crush it.</p>

<p>But God will bless it if it will do right, administering justice
to each and to all, protecting the weak as well as the
strong, and throwing the broad wings of its power equally
over men of every color. This is God-like, and God will bless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
his own image, be it in a nation or in a man. Then, O my
country, “shall thy light break forth as the morning—thy
health shall spring forth speedily—thy righteousness shall go
before thee,” and “the glory of the Lord shall be thy reward.”</p>

<p>Then shall justice be engraven on our arms, and righteousness
on our star-spangled banners; our armies shall then be
led to battle by the Lord, and victory secured by the right arm
of our God.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
